This button is for setting a animation of loading when pressed on it. 
We use 'useState' hook for putting up isLoad variable and default value is false
and handleClick for button click action. 

handleClick()-
1. set the isLoad to true by setIsLoad(true)
2. put timeout for 2s

for animation -
we use a div and in tailwind className we have these two attributes:
             "animate-spin" and  "rounded-full"

to switch on - 
1. if-  isLoad is true (after pressing the button from load function)
2. we append a a div and put some tailwind css in it
3. the bg is none but border is to "2 unit" 
4. and for center we use m-auto so margin left-right is equal and div is in center
5. set border-top color to border-top-red-600 
6. else-  set text to "Button Load"
