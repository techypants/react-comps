This is a TypeScript based solution for radio button automation 
from a list of fields and values. When the buttons are pressed, 
it adds a "✔️" mark to show selected button.

list of buttons:
items- since in TS we need to keep in mind the types of each variable
       items:{value:String,label:string}[] - this is how a list is declared
       then values are input into the list
        { value:'music',label:'Music'}

We use useState hook to manage the label string value with variable value,setValue function
and "useState<string|null> (null)" means either string or null but default is null

function handleChange-
    set value of variable value to "e -> target -> value" 
    

in return- 
    we use map function on items list 
    1. takes item and returns 
    <div key={item.value}>  
    amd a div to contain label and input
    2. name and type is pre-set for all buttons but value, id is passed from item.value

    3. label name is set to item.value by default
    4. if value variable is equal to item.value, set the label name to 
            item.value + "✔️"
