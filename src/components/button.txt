This button is for changing the text to "Loading..." for 2 seconds 
after you press on it.

We use 'useState' hook for putting up isLoading variable and default value is false
and handleClick for button click action. 

handleClick()-
1. set the isLoading to true
2. put timeout for 2s

In button-
1. onClick redirects to handleClick function
2. disabled value is equal to isLoading value
3. set the text to 'Loading...' or 'Click me' according to isLoading value
